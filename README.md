## 🧑‍💻 How the Program Works

1. The user is asked to enter the student's name.  
2. The program then asks for marks and checks if the input is valid.  
3. If invalid data is entered, the program keeps asking until correct input is provided.  
4. Based on the marks, the appropriate grade and message are selected.  
5. The final result is displayed in a clean formatted output.
